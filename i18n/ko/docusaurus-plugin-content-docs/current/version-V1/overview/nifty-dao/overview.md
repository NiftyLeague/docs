We will gradually be transferring ownership of Nifty League to the Nifty League DAO in order to decentralize the platform and encourage developers and artists to help build! 우리의 비전은 커뮤니티 기여를 통해 빠른 성장과 발전을 가능하게 하여 다른 어느 게임 플랫폼과도 비교할 수 없는 게임 플랫폼을 구축할 수 있도록 하는 것입니다. 간단히 말해서 DAO는 미래입니다. 우리는 세계 최고의 GameFi 플랫폼이 되는 단 하나의 길을 보고 있습니다. 그것은 함께 구축하는 것입니다.

[NFTL](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/nftl/overview) is our native governance token which provides voting rights and other other utilities. Our DAO's treasury assets are held within a Gnosis multi-sig wallet that will be used to handle distributions to future project contributors, as well as [tournaments](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/p2e/tournaments) and other activities. We plan on migrating our treasury to Arbitrum once their Gnosis integration is complete to benefit from lower fees and more frequent distributions to community contributors going forward.

The core team is actively looking for notable members of our community to join our multi-sig committee to handle treasury operations and guarantee proposals are on-chain according to the DAO's guidelines (WIP). Please contact a [Community Moderator](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/team) in [Discord](https://discord.gg/niftyleague) for more information.
