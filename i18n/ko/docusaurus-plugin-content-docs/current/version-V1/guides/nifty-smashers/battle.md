### General advice

- Playing with a controller highly recommended (PS, Xbox, â€¦, recognized by PC/Mac)

### Bat swings

- Bat can be swung in all possible direction: left, right, up, down, diagonals
- Bat can be swung by clicking the attack button. Longer button press makes the bat hit harder
- Bat can be swung during standing, running, jumping
- Long press attack button during jumps is possible (possibly surprising opponents)

### Moving

- As a 2D-Game, moving directions are left/right
- Directions can be changed during jumps/tumble

### Jumping

- Jump height can be altered by press-duration of jump button
- Directions can be changed during jumps/tumble

### Flying Hamburger

- Makes the bat hit much stronger - results most times in a direct kill
- For update: limit burger buff duration by time and/or kill
