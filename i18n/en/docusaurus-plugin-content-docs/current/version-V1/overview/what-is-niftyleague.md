Our mission is to create a leading NFT gaming platform through community governance and development. Nifty League prides itself on being one of the first GameFi platforms offering interactive play-to-earn games with customizable characters; not just another pfp drop... ðŸ™ƒ

Users design, mint, and play as their personal character(s) to compete and earn rewards within our community including our ecosystem's token; NFTL. Purchasing an Ethereum DEGEN not only provides you with NFTL tokens, but unlocks multiplayer modes within our games granting you admission to public tournaments.

Our team strives to make our games highly competitive and packed full of nostalgia from the halcyon days of retro gaming! At launch weâ€™ll release our first game Nifty Smashers; an NFT brawler for you to battle it out with your friends and Crypto Twitter! We have several upcoming game options that weâ€™ll develop based on community input but ultimately hope to see our platformâ€™s growth reach limits unseen with the support of community devs (more info below).
