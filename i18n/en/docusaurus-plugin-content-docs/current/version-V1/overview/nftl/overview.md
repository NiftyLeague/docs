NFTL acts as a way to decentralize our ecosystem by ensuring important decisions regarding the direction of Nifty League are decided via the Nifty DAO. The sale of our characters kicked off the initial distribution of our ecosystemâ€™s native utility and governance token; NFTL. NFTL serves a dual purpose of giving users voting rights on upcoming games and tournaments as well as being used for platform-wide expenses. For now, this only includes naming characters, but may be expanded to be used for purchasing additional in-game items, collectibles or even potential future characters. Any NFTL used for naming characters is immediately burned or removed from circulation. If and when additional in-game items are introduced, 90% of all proceeds will be given to the Nifty DAO with the remaining 10% paid to our team.
