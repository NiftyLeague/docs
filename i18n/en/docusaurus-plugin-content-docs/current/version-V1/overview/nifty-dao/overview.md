We will gradually be transferring ownership of the Nifty League to our DAO in order to decentralize the platform and encourage devs to help us build! Our vision is to power rapid growth and development through community contributions enabling us to build a gaming platform like no other. Simply put, DAOs are the future. We see only one route to becoming the world's leading GameFi platform and thatâ€™s by building together. ðŸ’œ

**NFTL** is our native governance token which provides voting rights and other other utilities (more info [below](https://nifty-league.com/about#nftl)). Our DAO's treasury assets are held within a Gnosis multi-sig wallet which will be used to handle distributions to future project contributors as well as tournaments and other activities. We plan on migrating our treasury over to **Arbitrum** once their Gnosis integration is complete to benefit from lower fees and more frequent distributions to community contributors going forward.

**We are actively looking for notable members of our community to join our multi-sig committee to handle treasury operations and guarantee proposals are respective on-chain according to the DAO's guidelines. Please get in touch if you think you would be a good fit!**
