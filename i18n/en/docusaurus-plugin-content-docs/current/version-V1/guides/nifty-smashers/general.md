### Scoring

- If a degen is hit once and dies (fall off map) you get one point
- If a degen is hit multiple times without being able recover, you get points as often as the degen was hit. It doesn’t matter if previous hits were done by another degen. Last hit that is killing the degen, gets all combo points
- **Currently there is no cap of how often a degen can be hit (combo’ed) but a cap on how much points you can get max (3pts: 2-player match / 5pts: 3&4-player match)**
- 2-player-match: 5pts to win round / 3&4-player-match: 10pts to win round
- Matches are Bo5. If there is a tie after the fifth round, the tied player move into a sudden death round

### Lag Indicator

- your lag (ping speed) of your connection
- lag usually means above 100ms

### Custom Lobby

- A custom lobby can be used to open a match in a chosen region. The creator of the lobby can see a code in the lobby map which can be shared with others
- If another degen want to join this lobby, he first needs to select the correct region and then type the lobby code into a input box
- For update: when using a custom lobby code, the region should be switched automatically

### How and why to change regions?

- Smasher is a fast paced game where good latency/ping is crucial. The nearer the chosen region is to the player’s location, the lower the ping is.
- After changing the region in the web/desktop-App, the current ping is displayed
