We will gradually be transferring ownership of Nifty League to the Nifty League DAO in order to decentralize the platform and encourage developers and artists to help build! Vår visjon er å drive rask vekst og utvikling gjennom samfunnsbidrag, slik at vi kan bygge en spillplattform uten like. Enkelt sagt, DAO er fremtiden. Vi ser bare én vei til å bli verdens ledende GameFi-plattform, og det er ved å bygge sammen.

[NFTL](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/nftl/overview) is our native governance token which provides voting rights and other other utilities. Our DAO's treasury assets are held within a Gnosis multi-sig wallet that will be used to handle distributions to future project contributors, as well as [tournaments](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/p2e/tournaments) and other activities. We plan on migrating our treasury to Arbitrum once their Gnosis integration is complete to benefit from lower fees and more frequent distributions to community contributors going forward.

The core team is actively looking for notable members of our community to join our multi-sig committee to handle treasury operations and guarantee proposals are on-chain according to the DAO's guidelines (WIP). Please contact a [Community Moderator](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/team) in [Discord](https://discord.gg/niftyleague) for more information.
