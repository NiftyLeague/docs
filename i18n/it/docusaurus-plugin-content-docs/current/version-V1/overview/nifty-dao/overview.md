We will gradually be transferring ownership of Nifty League to our Nifty DAO in order to decentralize the platform and encourage developers and artists to help build! Our vision is to power rapid growth and development through community contributions, enabling us to build a gaming platform like no other. In poche parole, i DAO sono il futuro. Vediamo solo un percorso per diventare la piattaforma GameFi leader nel mondo ed Ã¨ costruire insieme.

NFTL is our native governance token which provides voting rights and other other utilities ([more info can be found here below](https://nifty-league.com/about#nftl)). Our DAO's treasury assets are held within a Gnosis multi-sig wallet that will be used to handle distributions to future project contributors, as well as tournaments and other activities. We plan on migrating our treasury to **Arbitrum** once their Gnosis integration is complete to benefit from lower fees and more frequent distributions to community contributors going forward.

The core team is actively looking for notable members of our community to join our multi-sig committee to handle treasury operations and guarantee proposals are on-chain according to the DAO's guidelines. Please contact a community mod in [Discord](https://discord.gg/niftyleague) for more information.
