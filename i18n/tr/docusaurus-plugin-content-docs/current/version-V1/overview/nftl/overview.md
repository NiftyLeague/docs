The sale of our characters kicked off the initial distribution of our ecosystem’s native utility and governance token, [NFTL](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nifty-league).

NFTL is currently only available for trading and staking on [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/).

NFTL helps decentralize our ecosystem by ensuring important decisions regarding the direction of Nifty League are decided via the [Nifty League DAO](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/nifty-dao/overview).

NFTL serves a dual purpose of giving users voting rights on upcoming games and tournaments, as well paying for platform-wide expenses. For now, this only includes naming characters, but will soon be expanded to be used for purchasing additional in-game items and collectibles.

Any NFTL used for naming characters is immediately burned (removed from circulation). When additional in-game items are introduced, 90% of all proceeds will be given to the Nifty League DAO, and the remaining 10% will be paid to the core team.

NFTL will also be required to pay for Degen [Rentals](https://docs.niftyleague.com/guides/rentals/rental-overview), and to purchase land in the [Niftyverse](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/games/niftyverse).
