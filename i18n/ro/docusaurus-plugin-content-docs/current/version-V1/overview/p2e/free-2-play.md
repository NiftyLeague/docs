[Nifty Smashers](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/games/nifty-smashers) Free-to-Play ("F2P") will launch in March 2022. F2P este cheia fluxului de îmbarcare a chiriașului și proprietarului. Intenționăm să lansăm inițial pe desktop și mai târziu pe mobil, inclusiv Android și iOS.

In F2P, players will be able to jump into the game immediately.

Grinding will earn players NFTL over time, which will help the player be able to earn enough to rent a DEGEN. Please note, players' preferred crypto wallets will need to be connected to claim any NFTL earned via grinding.

Jucătorii F2P nu vor arăta ca un DEGEN tipic. It's important for other players to be able to distinguish between F2P and DEGEN owners and renters within the gaming ecosystem. Given this, F2P players will appear like 'dummy' DEGENs, and players will be able to select the tribe they wish to play, as testing a DEGEN trib prior to purchasing or renting is important.
