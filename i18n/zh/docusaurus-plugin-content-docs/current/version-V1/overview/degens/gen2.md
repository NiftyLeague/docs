重要的是要注意，我们创世纪 **** 中的独特特征组合将 **_永远不会_** 再铸造，任何新一代角色都将设计为对原始部落进行独特的扭曲，或者全新的部落和特征共。 虽然所有 Nifty League NFT 都将有机会通过玩我们的游戏和为社区做出贡献来赚取每日奖励，但只有 Ethereum **DEGEN** 持有者将在前 3 年</strong> ****NFTL** 代币，如我们的代币排放中所述。</p>

We are always monitoring demand on other blockchains, and will consider expanding to another EVM-compatible blockchain in order to onboard new users and enable cross-chain gaming. This may also become a requirement if we introduce games which require frequent user transactions. If we move multi-chain, **60%** of all proceeds from future character sales will be sent to the **Nifty DAO** with the remainder going to the core team for putting the infrastructure in place and preparing new contracts and characters for the new blockchain(s). Current Ethereum **DEGEN** holders should expect a free NFT mint on future blockchain(s) as well.
