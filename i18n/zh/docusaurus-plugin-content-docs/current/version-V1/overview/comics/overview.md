During minting, we surprised the community with a special Nifty League launch Comic Collection to say thank you for minting our collection and for being early. Our Comic NFTs are all ERC-1155’s.

Snapshots for comics were taken throughout the minting process for the first 4 comic pages at the following milestones:

- Page 1 - 2500
- Page 2 - 3500
- Page 3 - 5000
- Page 4 - 7500

Our collection of Comics 1-4 are available for purchase on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/nifty-league-launch-comics).

The Nifty League Comic Collection consists of 6 pages with Comics 5 and 6 yet to be released (coming in February/March 2022).

There was a snapshot on 1/31/2022 for Comic 5 awarded to all DEGEN holders, and Comic 6 awarded to all wallets containing all 6 DEGEN tribes.

All [Meta background](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/degens/backgrounds) DEGENs will receive one Comic 6, and all [Legendary background](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/degens/backgrounds) DEGENs will receive two Comic 6 NFTs. These will be made available via a claim flow on [our website](https://niftyleague.com/) (coming soon).

每部漫画都可以在未来的某个日期被烧毁，以换取每页被烧毁的游戏内可穿戴设备或武器。 These items modify a DEGEN's P2E multiplier when worn.

我们仍在确定每个 DEGEN 可以填充多少个插槽，但每个 DEGEN NFT 只能分配每个可穿戴设备中的 1 个。

下面是每个相应可穿戴设备的可穿戴乘数强度的描述。 The exact rates are still being determined.

**Comic 1**: 💪💪💪💪💪  
**Comic 2**: 💪💪💪💪  
**Comic 3**: 💪💪💪  
**Comic 4**: 💪💪  
**Comic 5**: 💪  
**Comic 6**: 💪💪💪💪💪💪
