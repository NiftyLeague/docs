We will gradually be transferring ownership of Nifty League to the Nifty League DAO in order to decentralize the platform and encourage developers and artists to help build! 我们的愿景是通过社区贡献推动快速增长和发展，使我们能够建立一个与众不同的游戏平台。 简单地说，DAO 就是未来。 我们认为只有一条途径可以成为世界领先的 GameFi 平台，那就是共同构建。

[NFTL](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/nftl/overview) is our native governance token which provides voting rights and other other utilities. Our DAO's treasury assets are held within a Gnosis multi-sig wallet that will be used to handle distributions to future project contributors, as well as [tournaments](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/p2e/tournaments) and other activities. We plan on migrating our treasury to Arbitrum once their Gnosis integration is complete to benefit from lower fees and more frequent distributions to community contributors going forward.

The core team is actively looking for notable members of our community to join our multi-sig committee to handle treasury operations and guarantee proposals are on-chain according to the DAO's guidelines (WIP). Please contact a [Community Moderator](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/team) in [Discord](https://discord.gg/niftyleague) for more information.
