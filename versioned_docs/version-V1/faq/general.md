## Does it cost to play Nifty Smashers?

Today, you must own a DEGEN NFT to play Nifty Smashers. We will soon be launching a rental system, where you can rent a DEGEN NFT for a weekly fee.

## How do I add the NFTL token to metamask?

Click the NL icon on the profile section of our website to add the token visibility to your Metamask.

## Do I need more than one DEGEN to play the game?

No, you only need one DEGEN NFT to play.

## How do I import my DEGENs into the game?

As simple as signing a message to verify the ownership of your DEGENs in your crypto wallet when you launch the game.

## Where can I play the game?

Games are playable on your favorite web browsers as long as it supports crypto wallet extensions. We also have a desktop app available for Window users at the moment with MacOS coming soon!

## Do I need controllers to play the game?

No, although we think it's easier to play with a controller (PS, Xbox, or any others recognized by PC/Mac) than a keyboard.

## Will I be able to use my DEGENs in other ecosystems?

Yes! We are currently partnered with [Pixlverse](https://twitter.com/ThePixlverse) and [WorldWideWeb3]{https://twitter.com/Worldwide_WEB3}, and cross-platform gameplay is under development! We plan to partner with more projects over time.

## How do I verify my DEGENs in Discord?

Head over to the #verify-degens channel in the official [Nifty League discord](https://discord.gg/niftyleague). Connect your wallet to Collab.Land and you’re good to go! Make sure you’re using the link generated within the channel. Collab.Land will never DM you! Verifying your degen gets you access to the #degen-lair where you can receive tips in NFTL!

## Why is the genesis DEGEN NFT max supply 9.9k/10k?

The final 100 spots are set aside to mint special DEGENs that will be given away for free as future community incentives from the Nifty DAO!

## Why is the rename asking for multiple verifications?

Renaming a character costs 1k NFTL, which is immediately burned by the NiftyDegen smart contract. In order to enable the contract to spend your NFTL, you will initially need to increase the spending allowance by at least 1k NFTL. By default, this approval is set to 1k but if you plan on renaming multiple characters you can increase the allowance to avoid having to increase the allowance in the future.
