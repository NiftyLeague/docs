### **Does it cost to play Nifty Smashers?**

Today, you must own a DEGEN NFT to play Nifty Smashers. We will soon be launching a rental system, where you can rent a DEGEN NFT for a weekly fee. 

## Where can I play the game?

Games are playable on your favorite web browsers as long as it supports crypto wallet extensions. We also have a desktop app available for Window users at the moment with MacOS coming soon!

### **Do I need more than one DEGEN to play the game?**

No, you only need one DEGEN to play.

### How do I import my DEGENs into the game?

As simple as signing a message to verify the ownership of your DEGENs in your crypto wallet when you launch the game.

### **Do I need controllers to play the game?**
No, although we think it's easier to play with a controller(PS, Xbox, or any others recognized by PC/Mac) than a keyboard. 

### Why is the rename asking for multiple verifications?

Renaming a character costs **1000 NFTL** which is immediately burned by the **NiftyDegen** smart contract. In order to enable the contract to spend your NFTL, you will initially need to increase the spending allowance by at least 1000 NFTL. By default, this approval is set to 1000 but if you plan on renaming multiple characters you can increase the allowance to avoid having to increase the allowance in the future.
