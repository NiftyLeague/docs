No, although we think it's easier to play with a controller (PS, Xbox, or any others recognized by PC/Mac) than a keyboard.

<details><summary>Why is the genesis DEGEN NFT max supply 9.9k/10k?</summary><br/>

The final 100 DEGENs in the genesis collection are of a mysterious seventh tribe. These special DEGENs have been set aside as prizes for potential tournaments, lotteries or other community incentives from the Nifty League DAO.

<details><summary>Will there be additional generations of DEGENs created in the future?</summary><br/>

Whether or not we create further generations of DEGEN NFTs will be decided by the Nifty League DAO in the future.

</details>

<details><summary>Will I be able to use my DEGENs in other ecosystems?</summary><br/>

Yes! We are currently integrating with [WorldWideWeb3](https://twitter.com/Worldwide_WEB3) and [Sappy Seals](https://twitter.com/SappySealsNFT) in their future metaverse, called [Pixlverse](https://twitter.com/ThePixlverse). In the PixlVerse, we‚Äôve been given land grants to develop and build our DEGENs a place to engage with other communities.

We are constantly working on partnership integrations - please reach out to our community moderators if you are interested in working with us.

<details><summary>What is the utility/function of DEGEN backgrounds?</summary><br/>

Backgrounds come with special perks such as a distinguished look in game and extra NFTL earning multipliers with the following rates:

- Common: x1
- Rare: x2
- Meta: x3
- Legendary: x6

Read more about [DEGEN backgrounds](/docs/overview/degens/backgrounds).

</details>

<details><summary>Why is the DEGEN rename asking for multiple verifications?</summary><br/>

Renaming a character costs 1k NFTL, which is immediately burned by the Nifty Degen smart contract. In order to enable the contract to spend your NFTL, you will initially need to increase the spending allowance by at least 1k NFTL. By default, this approval is set to 1k but if you plan on renaming multiple characters you can increase the allowance to avoid having to increase the allowance in the future.
