**Does it cost to play Nifty Smashers?**
Playing online is as simple as signing a free message to verify you own a DEGEN! In the future we may introduce more games that require frequent user transactions but this style of games will likely be implemented on another blockchain to avoid heavy fees.

**Do I need more than one DEGEN to play the game?**
Not for our offline multiplayer beta. After we launch the online multiplayer, you need one DEGEN per controller **Do I need controllers to play the game?**
Yes, you need at least one controller in addition to the keyboard to play the offline multiplayer. Keyboard can be used for online multiplayer if you are planning to join the others alone, but multiple controllers can be used as well.

**When will you open the game up to online multiplayer?**
In a short few weeks, in October. We will be announcing the online multiplayer’s launch very soon.

**Why aren't all the traits available?**
As our sale progresses, the contract will randomly remove used traits from availability giving you the chance of getting a 1 of 1 trait type.

**Why does the image of my DEGEN say "Image Unavailable"?**
Due to high traffic, some images may take some time to generate. If it’s been over 10 minutes since your purchase - ping a member of our team and we will make sure it gets processed.

**Why is the rename asking for multiple verifications?**
Renaming a character costs **1000 NFTL** which is immediately burned by the **NiftyDegen** smart contract. In order to enable the contract to spend your NFTL, you will initially need to increase the spending allowance by at least 1000 NFTL. By default, this approval is set to 1000 but if you plan on renaming multiple characters you can increase the allowance to avoid having to increase the allowance in the future.

**Where can I play the games?**
Games are playable on your favorite web browsers as long as it supports crypto wallet extensions.

**Can I mint as many DEGENs as I want?**
Yes, we are not limiting the number of DEGENs owned by a single wallet.

**How do I import my DEGENs into the game?**
As simple as signing a message to verify the ownership of your DEGENs when you launch the game.
