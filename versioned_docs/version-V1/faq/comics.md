<details><summary>What is the purpose/utility of Nifty League comics?</summary><br/>

Each comic can be burned for in-game wearables that will increase your NFTL multiplier. Each comic corresponds with a specific wearable that will earn NFTL at different rates based on the rarity of the comic. A full set of comics, 1-6, can also be exchanged for a mystery item. Alternatively, you can always choose to hold on to your comics after the burning window â€” you never know what Satoshi has up his sleeve!
