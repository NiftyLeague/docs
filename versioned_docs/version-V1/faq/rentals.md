<details><summary>Where do I rent a DEGEN?</summary><br/>

The DEGEN rentals flow will live on the Nifty League website, but is not live yet!

</details>

<details><summary>Where can I learn more about DEGEN rentals?</summary><br/>

Read more about our plans for DEGEN rentals [here](/docs/guides/rentals/rental-overview).

</details>

<details><summary>What is a Club, Sponsor and Recruit?</summary><br/>

We use the term **Club** to refer to a group of players. In web3/P&E gaming, these are typically referred to as Guilds. Furthermore, **Clubs** will be core to the Nifty Ecosystem, with in-game social features where DEGENs can proudly represent their **Clubs** on their profile and in-game.  
  
We use the term **Sponsor** to refer to a **Club** (or other DEGEN Owner) who has paid for a DEGEN rental on behalf of a player. In web3/P&E gaming, **Sponsors** are typically just Guilds, but at Nifty Leauge, owning your NFT means your can rent it out to any player you wish!  

We use the term **Recruit** to refer to a player and member of the community who is sponsored by a **Club** or DEGEN **Owner**.  

</details>

<details><summary>Why is there an NFTL earning cap on DEGEN rentals?</summary><br/>

Having a cap on our emissions helps our ecosystem in maintaining a more sustainable and stable emission level, which is desirable to both token holders and players.

</details>

<details><summary>Why is the rental price curve so steep?</summary><br/>

We have set the curve based on player-base size, which will be readjusted dynamically as the player-base grows. The curve helps ensure the rental spread is fair across all background multipliers.
  
</details>

<details><summary>How can the rental price curve possibly support more players?</summary><br/>

The curve will start out steeper to create a fair spread across all DEGENs while supporting more renting activity on DEGENs with higher multipliers.

</details>

<details><summary>How can the cap and rental fee keep up with the NFTL market?</summary><br/>

Earning rates, rentals price and the rental cap will be closely monitored and periodically adjusted based on the needs of the community.

</details>

<details><summary>The owner's share of in-game earnings is too low! How can I change it?</summary><br/>

The first version of the rental system will set the Owner’s share to 10%. Our second version of the rental system will include a feature allowing Owners to set the share of in-game earnings they wish to keep, which could range anywhere from 0% to 100%.

</details>

<details><summary>Can the Sponsor shares of in-game earnings be adjusted?</summary><br/>

The first version of the rental system will set the Sponsor’s share to 50%. Our second version of the rental system will include a feature allowing Sponsors to set the share of in-game earnings they wish to keep. The Sponsor will be able to set the % split with the remainder of earnings left after the Owner’s share is removed.  

For example, if the Owner set his in-game earnings share to 20%, the Sponsor could choose to keep e.g. 80%, leaving the Player/Recruit 0%, or e.g. 10%, leaving the Player/Recruit 70%.  
  
</details>

  
<details><summary>Can the Player/Recruit shares of in-game earnings be adjusted?</summary><br/>

The first version of the rental system will set the Player (Recruit if sponsored) share to 40%. Our second version of the rental system will include a feature allowing Owners and Sponsors to set the share of in-game earnings they wish to keep. This means, the Player/Recruit’s share is the remaining in-game earnings share not taken by the Owner and Sponsor.

</details>

<details><summary>Are in-game earnings capped on the DEGENs I own?</summary><br/>
  
Yes, all DEGENs have their weekly earnings capped based on their multiplier. This ensures that our most active players are spreading the love (and NFTL) to other DEGENs as well!
  
</details>

<details><summary>How much NFTL can I expect to earn per match?</summary><br/>

It will depend on your skill level, but you will be rewarded for every play you make in Nifty Smashers.  Each kill, hit, ability hit, round win, or match win will reward you with points, which translate into NFTL rewards after the match. Remember that you can also lose points for unassisted deaths!

</details>

<details><summary>What happens to the weekly rental fee?</summary><br/>

45% of the fee is given to the Owner.  
5% of the fee is given to Nifty League (initially the Corporation, later the DAO). 
50% of the fee is burned (removed from the ecosystem). 

</details>

<details><summary>What happens to the daily rental fee?</summary><br/>

10% of the fee is given to the Owner. 
10% of the fee is given to Nifty League (initially the Corporation, later the DAO). 
80% of the fee is burned (removed from the ecosystem). 

</details>

<details><summary>How does the rental fee work?</summary><br/>
  
You can initiate a rental by paying the initial rental fee, which covers the cost of the rental for one week. After the first week, the rental switches to daily with a 30% discount on the rentals fees. The daily rental fee will be charged until the rental is terminated or until the DEGEN is no longer available for rent.

</details>

<details><summary>How does the rental cap work?</summary><br/>

The rental is initiated with a weekly cap that will apply to the first week’s earnings until the rental switches over to daily, at which point the cap will be incremented daily by each daily rental fee charge.

</details>

<details><summary>What happens after I hit the earning cap on my rental?</summary><br/>

You can still play but you won’t earn NFTL until the rental is in the daily period. At which point the cap will be bumped each day. Can’t wait? You can alway initiate rentals on a new/different DEGEN at any time!

</details>

<details><summary>Can I take my DEGEN off the market if it has already been rented?</summary><br/>

The existing rentals on your DEGEN will be terminated at the end of the ongoing rental period. After which, your DEGEN will no longer be possible to rent by the public. Keep in mind that re-activating a DEGEN rental costs 1,000 NFTL.

</details>

<details><summary>Can I sponsor another player for a DEGEN rental?</summary><br/>

If a DEGEN is available on the market to the public, anyone can sponsor a DEGEN rental for another player. If a DEGEN is disabled from the public market, only the DEGEN Owner can sponsor another player’s rental.

</details>

<details><summary>What is a rental pass?</summary><br/>
  
Rental passes are similar to coupon, meaning they enable you to rent a DEGEN for free - either for yourself or another player! Please note, rental passes can only be used on DEGENs with Common backgrounds without any active rentals.

</details>

<details><summary>How can I get a rental pass?</summary><br/>

Raffles and giveaways.
  
</details>

<details><summary>Can I terminate a rental?</summary><br/>

You can terminate your rental at any time. The rental will stay active until the end of the period for which it’s been paid. You will not be issued a NFTL refund for a rental that is terminated prior to last day of the rental period.

</details>

<details><summary>How do I terminate a rental?</summary><br/>

Navigate to the Owner, Sponsor or Player/Recruit dashboard and tap cancel on the DEGEN you would like to terminate.

</details>

<details><summary>How is this sustainable?!</summary><br/>

It’s not. Link to Compete & Earn (be sure to explain that F2P P&E will still be active but for minimal amounts, the best path to earning will always be through Compete & Earn)

</details>

<details><summary>Will it be possible to add in-game items to rented DEGENs?</summary><br/>

Yes, once the items marketplace is live! This includes items acquired through comic burning as well.

</details>

<details><summary>Is there a maximum amount of times my DEGEN can be rented?</summary><br/>

No, but the rental fee increases with each subsequent rental.

</details>

<details><summary>Can the same two DEGENs play each other simultaneously in Nifty Smashers?</summary><br/>
  
Yes
  
</details>

<details><summary>What happens if I sell my DEGEN while a rental is active?</summary><br/>

The renter continues to rent your DEGEN, and the income from the rental goes to the new owner starting the moment it transfers to the new wallet.

</details>

<details><summary>How can rental passes be used?</summary><br/>

Rental Passes can only be used to rent Commons without active ongoing rentals. In the checkout flow for the DEGEN you wish to rent, select the ‘Use Rental Pass’ box on the dialog. Please note, if the rental pass does not work for the DEGEN, it is likely because the DEGEN either does not have a Common background, or has an ongoing active rental. If you are encountering other issues with your rental pass, please reach out to a Community Moderator in our Discord server.
