## What utility does NFTL have?

NFTL acts as a way to decentralize our ecosystem by ensuring important decisions regarding the direction of Nifty League are decided via the Nifty DAO. It serves a dual purpose of giving users voting rights on upcoming games and tournaments, as well as being used for platform-wide expenses. For now, this only includes naming characters, but may be expanded to be used for purchasing additional in-game items, collectibles or even potential future characters. .

## Where can I purchase NFTL?

Currently you can purchase NFTL by swapping ETH (or wETH) for NFTL on a decentralized trading platform like [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/).
