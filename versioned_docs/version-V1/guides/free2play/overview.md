## Getting started with Free-to-play

1. Navigate to the [Games page](https://niftyleague.com/games) on our website

2. Connect your Metamask (or other preferred crypto wallet - we support nearly all of them!) by tapping **Wallet** in the top bar

3. If you donâ€™t have Metamask installed, please [install it](https://metamask.io/)

4. When prompted, confirm the sign in dialog which confirms your wallet address

5. Select the WebGL or Desktop game

6. Our system will automatically check if you own a DEGEN or have an active DEGEN rental

7. If you own a DEGEN or have an active DEGEN rental, you will be prompted to enter the game

8. If you don't own a DEGEN or have an active DEGEN rental, you will be presented with the Free-to-play option, where you can select a tribe and enter the game

You may find [our guide](https://www.loom.com/share/2bedc69db7e84e1fb1084c2182b86149) for connecting your crypto wallet helpful.
