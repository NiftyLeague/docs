This guide describes how to set up your environment using a specific toolset: `Node.js` + `npm` + `hardhat`. It also shows you how to install the Uniswap V3 Periphery contracts, which are required for the contract examples in the Uniswap Docs V3 guides.

Once you have set up your environment, read the guides on liquidity mining, implementing swaps, and so on, which provide example contracts for those interactions.
