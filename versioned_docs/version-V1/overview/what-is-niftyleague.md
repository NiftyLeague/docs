Our mission is to create a leading NFT gaming platform through community governance and development. Nifty League prides itself on being one of the first GameFi platforms offering interactive play-to-earn games with customizable characters; not just another pfp drop... ðŸ™ƒ

Players use their personal character(s) to compete and earn rewards in our ecosystem's token; NFTL. Purchasing an Ethereum DEGEN not only provides you with NFTL tokens, but unlocks multiplayer modes within our games granting you admission to public tournaments.

Our team strives to make our games highly competitive and packed full of nostalgia from the halcyon days of retro gaming! At launch we released our first game Nifty Smashers; an NFT brawler where you battle it out with your DEGEN friends. We have several games on the roadmap for 2022 that weâ€™ll develop based on community input, but ultimately hope to see our platformâ€™s growth reach limits unseen with the support of community devs and indie game studios.
