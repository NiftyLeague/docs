DEGEN backgrounds were randomly assigned upon minting, which either resulted in a **Common** background or one of three special backgrounds: **Rare**, **Meta**, **Legendary**.

Backgrounds come with special perks such as a distinguished look in game and extra earning multipliers.

## Earnings Multipliers

- **Rare**: 2
- **Meta**: 3
- **Legendary**: 6

The earnings multipliers above are based off of the baseline Common NFTL earning amount for play-and-earn winnings in [Nifty Smashers](/docs/overview/games/nifty-smashers) gameplay.

_Please note, these multipliers are subject to change._
