Nifty League introduced a unique minting experience for the genesis drop in September 2021, which the community absolutely loved! People were able to design their own DEGEN NFTs using our Mint-O-Matic, with a set of traits of their choosing.

There are 6 tribes of DEGENs: apes, humans, dogs, frogs, cats, and aliens.

Each DEGEN's design affected available character traits and accessories, and determined certain in-game mechanics and special moves.

Minters were able to browse through already minted DEGENs to determine which tribes were rarer than others and what type of DEGEN they gravitated toward.

Although our NFTs minted out in October 2021, they can be purchased on the secondary market via [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/niftydegen).
