As our platform continues to grow, we'll aim for partnerships with other popular NFT projects to increase the player capacity for our games which are only available to **DEGEN** holders (...if you're reading this BAYC ðŸ’œ). Another option is to monitor demand and make a decision whether to expand to another EVM-compatible blockchain to onboard new users and enable cross-chain gaming. This may also become a requirement if we introduce games which require frequent user transactions. If so, **60%** of all proceeds from future character sales will be sent to the **Nifty DAO** with the remainder going to our team for putting the infrastructure in place and preparing new contracts and characters for the new blockchain(s). and current Ethereum **DEGEN** holders should expect a free NFT on the new blockchain(s).

It is important to note that the unique trait combinations from our genesis **DEGENS** will **_never_** be mintable again and any new generation of characters will either be designed with a unique twist on the original tribes, or completely new tribes and traits altogether. While all Nifty League NFTs will have the chance to earn daily rewards by playing our games and contributing to the community, only Ethereum **DEGEN** holders will earn daily **NFTL** tokens for the **first 3 years** as described in our token emissions.
