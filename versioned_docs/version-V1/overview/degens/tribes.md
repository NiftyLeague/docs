Our current game, Nifty Smashers, and all the future games will have a special move for each character type. This our the list of special moves on the first game:

- Ape - Throw boomerang bananas
- Alien - Teleport
- Cat - Pounce and get bat power and speed boost temporarily
- Frog - The tongue grapple hook
- Doge - Doge coin roll
- Human - Throw dynamites that explode on command

In the future, we envision that new "special" tribes may be released / reserved for scalability, new games, tournament rewards, and more.
