The Nifty League Comic Collection consists of 6 pages of Comics. Our Comic NFTs are all ERC-1155â€™s.

During minting, we surprised the community with a special Nifty League launch Comic Collection to say thank you for minting our collection and for being early. Snapshots for Comics were taken throughout the minting process for the first 4 Comic pages at the following milestones:

- **Comic 1** - 2500
- **Comic 2** - 3500
- **Comic 3** - 5000
- **Comic 4** - 7500

Our collection of **Comics 1-6** are available for purchase on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/nifty-league-launch-comics).

There was a snapshot on 1/31/2022 for **Comic 5** awarded to all DEGEN holders, and **Comic 6** awarded to all wallets containing all 6 DEGEN tribes.

In addition, all [Meta background](/docs/overview/degens/backgrounds) DEGENs received one **Comic 6** NFT, and all [Legendary background](/docs/overview/degens/backgrounds) DEGENs received two **Comic 6** NFTs. 

Each Comic will be burnable at a future date to receive an in-game wearable or weapon in exchange for each page burned. These items modify a DEGEN's P&E multiplier when worn.

We are still determining exactly how many slots can be filled per DEGEN, but only 1 of each wearable is assignable per DEGEN NFT.

Below is a depiction of wearable multiplier strength for each corresponding wearable. The exact rates are still being determined.

**Comic 1**: ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª  
**Comic 2**: ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª  
**Comic 3**: ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª  
**Comic 4**: ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª  
**Comic 5**: ðŸ’ª  
**Comic 6**: ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

Below is a list of items for each Comic's corresponding wearable: 

**Comic 1**: Cape  
**Comic 2**: Halo  
**Comic 3**: Diamond Bat  
**Comic 4**: Bread Bat  
**Comic 5**: Purple Bat  
**Comic 6**: Companion
