As if our minting process wasn’t already fun enough for you guys... we surprised the community with a special Nifty League launch comic collection! 😁

The comic consists of **6 pages**, each burnable to receive an in-game wearable or weapon tied to each page.

Satoshi told us he LOVES full collections in just about everything so think twice before you make too many decisions here.

Snapshots were taken throughout the minting process for the first 4 pages at the following milestones: **Page 1 - 2500 | Page 2 - 3500 | Page 3 - 5000 | Page 4 - 7500**.

**TL;DR**

- Each comic can be burned for a wearable item
- Items modify a degen's P2E multiplier when worn
- There will be value in holding unburned sets of comics as well
- All 6 comics can be burned together as a set for a special item
- that does NOT modify P2E multiplier

**Wearable Multiplier strength for Nifty League will be as follows**

Comic 1 💪💪💪💪💪
Comic 2 💪💪💪💪
Comic 3 💪💪💪
Comic 4 💪💪
Comic 5 💪
Comic 6 💪💪💪💪💪💪
