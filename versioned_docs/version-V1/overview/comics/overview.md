During minting, we surprised the community with a special Nifty League launch Comic Collection to say thank you for minting our collection and for being early. Our Comic NFTs are all ERC-1155â€™s.

Snapshots for comics were taken throughout the minting process for the first 4 comic pages at the following milestones:

- Page 1 - 2500
- Page 2 - 3500
- Page 3 - 5000
- Page 4 - 7500

Our collection of Comics 1-4 are available for purchase on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/nifty-league-launch-comics).

The Nifty League Comic Collection consists of 6 pages with Comics 5 and 6 yet to be released (coming in February/March 2022).

There was a snapshot on 1/31/2022 for Comic 5 awarded to all DEGEN holders, and Comic 6 awarded to all wallets containing all 6 DEGEN tribes.

All [Meta background](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/degens/backgrounds) DEGENs will receive one Comic 6, and all [Legendary background](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/degens/backgrounds) DEGENs will receive two Comic 6 NFTs. These will be made available via a claim flow on [our website](https://niftyleague.com/) (coming soon).

Each comic will be burnable at a future date to receive an in-game wearable or weapon in exchange for each page burned. These items modify a DEGEN's P2E multiplier when worn.

We are still determining exactly how many slots can be filled per DEGEN, but only 1 of each wearable is assignable per DEGEN NFT.

Below is a depiction of wearable multiplier strength for each corresponding wearable. The exact rates are still being determined.

**Comic 1**: ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª  
**Comic 2**: ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª  
**Comic 3**: ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª  
**Comic 4**: ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª  
**Comic 5**: ðŸ’ª  
**Comic 6**: ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

## Summary

- Each comic can be burned for a in-game wearable item
- These NFTs will be ERC-1155â€™s
- Items modify a degen's P2E multiplier when worn
- Alternatively, you can hold the comics for future utility we have not yet disclosed
