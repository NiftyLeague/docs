As if our minting process wasn’t already fun enough for you guys... we surprised the community with a special Nifty League launch comic collection! This was to say thank you for minting our collection and for being early 😁

Snapshots for comics were taken throughout the minting process for the first 4 comic pages at the following milestones: Page 1 - 2500 | Page 2 - 3500 | Page 3 - 5000 | Page 4 - 7500.

You are probably wondering, “What do I do with the Comics?”. Well, you are going to have some choices to make as they will have multiple utilities. So, there is a game within a game here for you to choose your own path. 

The Nifty League Comic Collection consists of 6 pages with comics 5 and 6 yet to be released. There will be a snapshot on 1/31/2022 for comic 5 awarded to all DEGEN holders and comic 6 awarded to all wallets containing all 6 DEGEN tribes. All Meta background DEGENS will receive one comic 6 and all Legendary background DEGENS will receive two comic 6s! These will be made available via a claim on our website.

Each comic will be burnable at a future date to receive an in-game wearable or weapon in exchange for each page burned. However, this burn window won’t be forever and each holder will be forced to make some tough decisions for the future of their collection.

Satoshi told us he loves full collections in just about everything…so think twice before you make too many decisions here.

**TL;DR**

- Each comic can be burned for a in-game wearable item
- These NFTs will be ERC-1155’s
- Items modify a degen's P2E multiplier when worn
- Alternatively, you can hold the comics for future utility we have not yet disclosed 
- All 6 comics can be burned together as a set for a special mystery item
- This mystery item will NOT modify the P2E multiplier

Below is a depiction of wearable multiplier strength for each corresponding wearable. The exact rates are still to be determined.

Comic 1 💪💪💪💪💪\
Comic 2 💪💪💪💪\
Comic 3 💪💪💪\
Comic 4 💪💪\
Comic 5 💪\
Comic 6 💪💪💪💪💪💪


We are still determining exactly how many slots can be filled per DEGEN, but only 1 of each wearable is assignable per DEGEN NFT.
