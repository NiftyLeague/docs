Nifty League Arcade Tokens are off-chain and not an ERC-20.

Arcade Tokens are currently used in our ecosystem to play the [WEN Game](https://app.niftyleague.com/games/wen-game). 

You do not have to own a DEGEN or have an active DEGEN rental to play WEN Game, all you need is an Arcade Token (1 Arcade Token = 1 play).

Arcade Tokens are sold in packs of 4. Currently, 1 pack of Arcade Tokens costs 1,000 NFTL. Arcade Tokens can be purchased using [NFTL](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nifty-league) via the [Dashboard](https://app.niftyleague.com/) or directly within the [game](https://app.niftyleague.com/games/wen-game).

Purchasing Arcade Tokens in the Dashboard can be done on (1) [the Games page](https://niftyleague-app.vercel.app/games) by clicking the **Buy Arcade Tokens** button in the WEN Game card, (2) [the Overview page](https://app.niftyleague.com/dashboard), or by clicking the **Buy Tokens** button in the Arcade Token Balance box.

A player must have an Arcade Token balance >0 to enter the WEN Game (after entering the game, additional Arcade Tokens can be purchased directly in-game if desired).

**All NFTL spent toward the purchase of Arcade Tokens will be burned â€” our ecosystemâ€™s first major NFTL sink ðŸ”¥**

**Currently, earning Arcade Tokens is based on Nifty Smashers gameplay, on a gamer profile basis:** (1) DEGEN Owners earn 4 Arcade Tokens every 24 hours with the completion of at least 1 game of Nifty Smashers, (2) DEGEN Renters earn 1 Arcade Token every 24 hours with the completion of at least 1 game of Nifty Smashers.

Future arcade games will use Arcade Tokens for gameplay as well.
