You do not have to own a DEGEN or have an active DEGEN rental to play [Crypto Winter](https://app.niftyleague.com/games/crypto-winter), all you need is an [Arcade Token](https://niftyleague.com/docs/overview/arcade-tokens/overview) (1 Arcade Token = 1 play). If you do not own a DEGEN you’ll play the game with a dummy DEGEN (tribe assignment is random but all tribes are supported). If you own a DEGEN you’ll be able to play the game with your DEGEN of choice.

Currently, earning Arcade Tokens that can be used to play Arcade Games is based on Nifty Smashers gameplay, on a gamer profile basis: (1) DEGEN Owners earn 4 Arcade Tokens every 24 hours with the completion of at least 1 game of Nifty Smashers, (2) DEGEN Renters earn 1 Arcade Token every 24 hours with the completion of at least 1 game of Nifty Smashers.

Crypto Winter is a game of timing and reflex. The purpose of the game is to try dodge as many snowballs or other hazards thrown your way!
