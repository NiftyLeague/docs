Get ready to brawl! The local-multiplayer version of **[Nifty Smashers](https://nifty-league.com/games)** was made available immediately at launch followed by the online multiplayer! So grab a few controllers üéÆ and play with friends.

Battle it out amongst the community and get in as many _bat bonks_ ü•ñon your friends as you can! **Nifty Smashers** takes inspiration from the classic Super Smash Bros game where the objective is to knock your opponents off the map to score points. In order to play you'll need a **DEGEN** to select for battle, and then use your keyboard, Playstation or Xbox controller as input (couch multiplayer works too!). From the game lobby you'll be able to select from any of your previously minted **DEGENs** you own in your wallet to show off your cool creations! Each tribe has a unique special move so experiment with different tribes and find the moveset that suits your playstyle best. Hold down the attack button for a charged-up bat attack, some special moves can also be charged. When you bonk another player, they‚Äôre worth 1 point. The more they‚Äôre successively bonked, the faster they bounce around and the more points they‚Äôre worth. Land the final mega-bonk to hit them off the map and claim all the points!

**As noted, this is a beta release of our initial game so lag and issues with pesky bots are to be expected.** Our immediate plan is to continue development on **Nifty Smashers** and to introduce more features such as additional combo moves and a progression system. Hop in our **[Discord](https://discord.gg/niftyleague)** to provide feedback and ideas on how we can improve **Nifty Smashers** and take it to the next level!

**Online Multiplayer Lag ‚òÅÔ∏è**

With the on-going alpha, let's talk about lag in fast-paced and snappy brawler games like **Nifty Smashers**.

Generally speaking, lag is always present whenever there is physical distance between the players on the internet. The greater the distance, the greater the lag. There are different techniques & tricks that developers use to compensate and hide the lag. We have implemented a number of these lag compensation techniques that veil the lag for the best experience possible. We have also incorporated solutions with servers all around the world so that we can match players closest to each other to minimize the lag as much as possible.

Nonetheless, considering the level of responsiveness fast-paced brawlers require ‚ö°, we are expecting some lag when we launch the online multiplayer.

We are excited to share our progress with you as soon as possible. Following the launch, with your feedback, we will do everything in our power to make the lag as unnoticeable as possible.

If you are interested in learning more about these techniques, here is a great read by Gabriel Gambetta about **[Lag Compensation](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-side-prediction-server-reconciliation.html)**.
