Our goal is to expand our platform with as many fun and exciting games as possible, which we believe is only possible with the help of our DEGEN community, including indie gaming studios.

We encourage developers to create games utilizing our characters which - if selected - will go live on our platform, and in return developers will be rewarded from the [Nifty League DAO](/docs/overview/nifty-dao/overview) for their contributions. Please share game ideas in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/niftyleague). If your game shows promise and viability weâ€™d love to share it with the community.

We are building a more formal process for indie gaming studios and artists to utilize the Nifty League art and branding while building games for Niftyverse - stay tuned.
