When renting a DEGEN NFT, you will receive temporary access to play our first game, Nifty Smashers.

In order to rent a DEGEN, you'll need NFTL in your crypto wallet (NFTL can be swapped for wETH on [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/)).

For more info and to get started please follow our [rental guide](/docs/guides/rentals/rental-overview).
